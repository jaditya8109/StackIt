## Problem Statement
Uploading large CSV files to google sheets is one of the most common activities analysts in various orgs work on. 

**Your task is to build a CSV importer for Google Sheets but of a different kind. 

Pre-text:** 
A typical CSV Importer makes it easier for the user to automatically populate a csv file on google sheets.

## Unique capability: 
a) If a user re-imports the same structured CSV file in a particular sheet, the CSV uploaded should not be overwritten but rather appended.
b) Once the csv is uploaded, a visualisation (charts, bar graph, pie chart) should be automatically created based on user input and should be emailed to user. Take the email id as input.
